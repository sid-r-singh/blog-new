Each shell script may contain
- Shell keywords such as if..else, do..while.
- Shell commands such as pwd, test, echo, continue, type.
- Linux binary commands such as w, who, free etc..
- Text processing utilities such as grep, awk, cut.
- Functions - add frequent actions together via functions. For example, /etc/init.d/functions file contains functions to be used by most or all system shell scripts in the /etc/init.d directory.
- Control flow statments such as if..then..else or shell loops to perform repeated actions.
